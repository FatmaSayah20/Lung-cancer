# Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict lung cancer using a public dataset. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for early detection based on patient features.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `lung cancer.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with all steps: data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine Learning models:
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Accuracy comparison and best model selection

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer) and contains lung cancer patient information and diagnoses.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
